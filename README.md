# Toontown-Toon-Creator

**===Requirements===**

Make sure to have Python 3. (I used Python 3.10 on Windows and Python 3.8.10 on Linux to test this, and both have worked fine without issues.)

I utilized Panda3D 3.10.10 in the development of this project, so best to use that if you can.

**===FAQ===**

I've put in a FAQ.txt file that should hopefully answer all your questions!
However, if you've got a question that wasn't answered in the FAQ, DM me on Discord at SomethingRandom#0768.
