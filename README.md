# Toontown-Toon-Creator

**===Requirements===**

Make sure to have Python 3. (I used Python 3.10 on Windows and Python 3.8.10 on Linux to test this, and both have worked fine without issues.)

I utilized Panda3D 3.10.10 in the development of this project, so best to use that if you can.

Discord server for this is https://discord.gg/TWE6gvBmUg

**Instructions**

1. Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

2. Do `pip install -r requirements.txt` in command prompt, this installs all dependencies for you

3. Extract phase files 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10 from the Toontown Rewritten phase files (https://toontownrewritten.fandom.com/wiki/Phase_files#Extracting_phase_files if you need help with that) and put them in the same directory as main.py

4. Open a terminal in the project directory and do `python main.py`, and the project should start working.
